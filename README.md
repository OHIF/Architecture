Architecture guidance for OHIF Projects

OHIF believes that pure HTML5/JavaScript based viewers is the future of medical imaging.  We also believe that all server
side functionality can be implemented using JavaScript which simplifies the technology stack to a single language.
This believe if based on the enhancements coming with JavaScript ES6 and the success of Node.JS on the server side.

Languages:
* JavaScript ES6 (as much as possible)
* JavaScript ES5 (third party libraries are acceptable)
* C/C++ (only if absolutely necessary)

Runtimes:
* Meteor (as much as possible)
* NodeJS (when meteor isn't appropriate)

Third Party Libraries
* Bootstrap 3
