# Architecture
Architecture guidance for OHIF Projects

OHIF believes that pure HTML5/JavaScript based viewers is the future of medical imaging.  We also believe that all server
side functionality can be implemented using JavaScript which simplifies the technology stack to a single language.
This believe if based on the enhancements coming with JavaScript ES6 and the success of Node.JS on the server side.

Languages:
* [JavaScript ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) - as much as possible
* JavaScript ES5 (third party libraries are acceptable)
* C/C++ (only if absolutely necessary)

Technologies:
* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) - as much as possible
* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) - when meteor isn't appropriate
* [Web Components](http://webcomponents.org/) - as much as possible
* [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) - base css/components
* [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) - baseline web components
* [JSPM](http://jspm.io/) - browser package registry
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - npm package registry

Tools
* [Mocha](http://unitjs.com/guide/mocha.html) - unit testing
* [6to5](https://6to5.org/) - ES6 transpiling
* [JetBrains WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - IDE
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - build tool for NPM modules
* [github](https://github.com/) - source control
